In my role as an ESW I visit people in their homes after they have had a stay in hospital or to keep them from needing to go into hospital. I normally use a key safe to gain access if the client is less mobile.  I assess the daily needs of the client, and encourage them to do as much for themselves as possible to keep them independent and not require ongoing care. Every client has different needs and I have to make quick assessments to what help each client requires. This can range from bathing, helping to dress, giving medication, preparing food, liaising with GP''s, district <span class="hl">nurses</span> and physiotherapists. I also arrange for any equipment to be installed that would help the client to go about their daily routine easier. I make a log of each visit and this is kept in the client''s home. The service only lasts for a maximum of four weeks so there is a quick turnaround of clients. I have been on many training courses including safe guarding, introduction to autism, diabetes and dementia.</p></div></div><div id="workExperience-EeRfkzqIdPebwRkqK6c2tA" class="work-experience-section "><div class="data_display"><div class="work_company"><span class="bold">Career Break</span></div><div class="separator-hyphen">-</div><p class="work_dates">September 2008 to November 2012</p><p class="work_description">to raise my daughter.</p></div></div><div id="workExperience-EeRfkzqIdPibwRkqK6c2tA" class="work-experience-section "><div class="data_display"><p class="work_title title">Sales Ledger Clerk / Credit Controller</p><div class="work_company"><span class="bold">King UK</span></div><div class="separator-hyphen">-</div><p class="work_dates">September 2004 to September 2008</p><p class="work_description">My role as a sales ledger clerk involved postal distribution to our sorting office, entering customer cheques on the system, allocating money to accounts, telephone queries reconciling the bank statement, visa payments and any other problems that arise in the day.&nbsp;<br>As a credit controller my role was to answer any incoming calls and deal with any queries that may arise, send out any statements, invoices, PODS and letters for accounts overdue, to call overdue accounts to chase for payment and help the senior credit controllers with spreadsheets and reconciling accounts.</p></div></div><div id="workExperience-EeRfkzqIdPmbwRkqK6c2tA" class="work-experience-section last"><div class="data_display"><p class="work_title title">Various Temp and Contract Roles</p><div class="work_company"><span class="bold">Barclays, Adecco</span> <div class="separator-hyphen">-</div> <div class="inline-block"><span>Zürich, ZH</span></div></div><div class="separator-hyphen">-</div><p class="work_dates">September 2000 to September 2004</p><p class="work_description">Sept 2000-Sept 2004    Various Temp and Contract Roles&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I started my office career as an office junior for an accountants.
